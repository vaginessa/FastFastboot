# FastFastboot
This code is based off [fastboot](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/eclair-sholes-release2/fastboot). It may or may not work at any given time.

The goal is to give a console, so that you can directly submit (not pre-defined) commands to any fastboot-type thing.
